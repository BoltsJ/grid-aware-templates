# Grid Aware Templates

Extends the Foundry VTT measured templates to allow for templates that measure
based on grid measurements, rather than predefined border shapes. The main
purpose for this is for nicer measured templates on hexagonal grids, but this
should also improve the experience on square grids, particularly if using
unusual measurement schemes such as 1-1-1 or 2-2-2.
